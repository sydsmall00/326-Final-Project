### **Files**:

**crazyeights.py**: Main program that runs the crazy eights game. The user plays the game with this script.
          
**test_crazyeights.py**: Script that tests crazy eights program functions/methods.
      
### **Command Line Instructions:**
Use "python3 crazyeights.py" for Mac
             **OR**
"python crazyeights.py" for Windows.

### **Crazy Eights Instructions:**
The game will ask you to input your **player name**.

Then, it will lay out your hand of cards, as well as the card at the top of the discard pile.

You must match either the **suit** or **face** of the card on top of the discard pile.

Or, if you have an **'8'**, you can change the suit to be your liking at any time. You must put down a card that matches the suit you changed to.

To run the program and complete these actions, you either input into the terminal:

         the number of the card in your hand that you want to discard,
         
         "new" if you need a new card (e.g. if you have no cards that match),
         
                  ex: input "3" if you want to discard the 3rd card in your hand
                  
         "help" if you do not know what to do (it will give you a hint!),
         
         or "exit" if you no longer want to play.
         
You will play until the deck, the compupter, or you run out of cards. The aim of the game is to strategically put down cards in your hand that amtch either the suit or the face of the card on top of the discard pile. You want to get rid of your cards in as little turns as possible.

To win, you must get rid of your cards before the computer does.
